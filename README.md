# CampusCrew

Activity-first campus matching prototype built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase.

## Current flow

`Home → Discover/Create → Plan → Join request → Creator approval → My Groups → Group overview → AI plan / Group chat → Notifications`

## Phase 1.1.3

This branch adds real Supabase authentication and user identity.

- Email/password sign up and login
- Logout from the navigation bar
- User profile page
- Authenticated plan creation
- Authenticated plan joining
- Plans and memberships store real Supabase Auth UUIDs
- Public discovery remains readable without logging in
- RLS migration for authenticated writes

## Local setup

Create `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=...

# Server-only importer credentials. Never use a NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix.
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
CRON_SECRET=...
UMN_EVENTS_FEED_URL=https://events.tc.umn.edu/live/json/events/max/250

# Server-only AI planning key. Never use a NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix.
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3.5-flash-lite
```

Then:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Database migration

Before testing Phase 1.1.3, run:

`supabase/migrations/001_auth.sql`

in the Supabase SQL Editor.

The migration creates the auth profile trigger, changes RLS so anonymous users can read plans while only authenticated users can create/join, and prevents duplicate plan membership for the same account.

## Deployment flow

Feature branches deploy as Vercel Preview deployments. Merge to `main` only after Preview testing passes; `main` remains the Production branch.

## Update log

### 2026-09-26 (America/Chicago) — Matching and recommendations

- Matching scores now use the signed-in student's courses, interests, and preferred group size instead of fixed mock scores. Profile settings can save courses and interests.
- Discover shows up to three recommended open plans with a shared course or interest, ranked by match score. Plans already joined, created by the student, or full are excluded. Everyone can still browse all plans.
- Without a signed-in profile or enough matching information, the UI gives a useful next step instead of inventing recommendations.
- Matching runs in the client with the existing Supabase profile and plan data; no database migration is needed. This version does not compare schedules because availability is not collected yet.

### 2026-09-26 (America/Chicago) — Join approval

- Students request to join an open plan; a pending request does not make them a member.
- The plan creator can approve or decline pending requests on the plan page. Approved students become members and can access their group. Declined students may request again.
- Database functions check creator ownership and group capacity inside a transaction. Direct membership inserts from the client are disabled, including the earlier unrestricted join route.
- Apply `supabase/migrations/002_join_approval.sql` after `001_auth.sql` and before deploying this branch. Existing confirmed members remain members; pending requests do not fill group slots.

### 2026-09-26 (America/Chicago) — Multiple groups

- My Groups now lists every plan where the signed-in student is a confirmed member, including plans they created. Each group has its own `/group/[id]` overview and direct link from the plan page.
- Group lists include plans regardless of open/closed status. Pending join requests do not appear until approved.
- Group membership is checked against the current user's confirmed `plan_members` records on every visit. No new database migration is required beyond the join approval migration.

### 2026-09-26 (America/Chicago) — Group chat

- Every group overview now has a separate chat. Confirmed members can read the latest 100 messages and send messages up to 2,000 characters; pending applicants cannot access it.
- Messages are stored in Supabase and update via Realtime when available, with a 15-second refresh fallback. Sender names come from confirmed membership records rather than client-supplied text.
- Apply `supabase/migrations/003_group_chat.sql` after `002_join_approval.sql` before deploying this branch. The migration adds member-only read access, a checked send function, and Realtime publication when available.

### 2026-09-26 (America/Chicago) — AI planning

- A group creator can generate one shared activity plan with preparation items, a timed agenda, and a backup plan. Confirmed group members can view the saved plan in their group overview.
- Generation uses the Gemini API with structured JSON output. Only the activity title, description, category, time, location, duration, and group size are sent; chat messages and member names are excluded. The API key stays on the server.
- Set server-side `GEMINI_API_KEY` and optionally `GEMINI_MODEL` (default `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`) in deployment settings. The free tier may use submitted data to improve Google's products. Apply `supabase/migrations/004_ai_planning.sql` after `003_group_chat.sql` before deploying this branch. No plan can be generated until both are configured.

### 2026-09-26 (America/Chicago) — Interests matching

- Creators can add up to 10 comma-separated interest tags when publishing a plan. Tags appear on discovery cards and plan details.
- Matching compares a student's saved profile interests to plan tags without case sensitivity or punctuation differences, including non-English interests. Shared interests appear as matching reasons and receive a higher score than course overlap. Existing plans without tags continue to match interests mentioned in their title, description, or category.
- Apply `supabase/migrations/005_interests_matching.sql` after `004_ai_planning.sql` before deploying this branch. Students can set or update their interests on the Profile page; no AI service is needed for interest matching.

### 2026-09-26 (America/Chicago) — Course matching

- Creators can add up to 10 course codes to a plan. Course labels appear on discovery cards and plan details; students can manage their own courses on the Profile page.
- Matching compares course codes without case, spaces, or punctuation differences, so `CSCI 4041` and `csci-4041` match. The matching reason lists up to three shared courses; plans without course labels still match course names mentioned in the title, description, or category. Interest matching and recommendations continue to work.
- Apply `supabase/migrations/006_course_matching.sql` after `005_interests_matching.sql` before deploying this branch. No external matching service or key is required.

### 2026-09-26 (America/Chicago) — Availability matching

- Students can select weekly availability on their Profile page in four six-hour periods for each weekday. Their time zone is recorded from the browser when availability is first saved, and saved settings continue to use that time zone.
- New activities require a future start date and time. Matching converts the activity timestamp into the student's saved time zone, checks the weekday and start-time period, and adds a visible availability reason and 25 points when it fits. Recommendations can now include an activity that matches on availability alone, and exclude activities whose scheduled start has passed.
- Older activities retain their readable time text and are never assigned a guessed availability match. The period represents when an activity *starts*, not whether the whole activity fits the student's schedule.
- Apply `supabase/migrations/007_availability_matching.sql` after `006_course_matching.sql` before deploying this branch; no external API key is needed.

### 2026-09-26 (America/Chicago) — Notifications

- Signed-in students receive in-app notifications when someone requests to join their plan, when their join request is approved or declined, and when another confirmed member sends a group chat message. Chat notifications include the sender and group name, without copying the message body.
- The navigation bar shows an unread count. `/notifications` lists the latest 100 notifications, opens the related plan or group, and marks the opened notification as read. Realtime updates are used where available, with a 20-second refresh fallback.
- Notifications are created by database triggers as part of the original request, review, or message transaction. Row-level security limits reads to the recipient; a checked database function marks only the signed-in recipient's notifications as read. Existing historical events are not backfilled.
- Apply `supabase/migrations/008_notifications.sql` after `007_availability_matching.sql` before deploying this branch. This is an in-app inbox; it does not send email or push messages.

### 2026-09-27 (America/Chicago) — CampusCrew branding

- Renamed the visible project name, browser title, and npm package to CampusCrew.
- Added a compact two-ring SVG mark to the navigation bar and browser tab. The editable asset is `public/campuscrew-mark.svg`; no database migration or new environment variable is required.

### 2026-09-27 (America/Chicago) — UMN-inspired logo colors

- Updated the original CampusCrew two-ring logo to a maroon `#6D001F` background and gold `#FFCC33` accent, using the University of Minnesota's current color palette. The logo remains an original CampusCrew design, rather than a university mark.

### 2026-09-27 (America/Chicago) — Others category

- Renamed the `Build` activity category to `Others` in the creation form, discovery filter, activity cards, and demo data. Until the migration runs, existing `Build` plans also appear as `Others` in the app.
- Apply `supabase/migrations/009_others_category.sql` after `008_notifications.sql` to rename existing database rows. The migration only changes the category label; it preserves the plans and their members.

### 2026-09-27 (America/Chicago) — Plan deletion and administrator roles

- Plan creators can permanently delete their own plans from the plan page. Administrators can delete any plan from the plan page or `/admin`. Deletion also removes associated group content, memberships, requests, chat messages, and notifications through existing database cascades; both screens ask for confirmation.
- `/admin` lists users and plans and lets an administrator grant or remove administrator roles. Administrators cannot remove their own role. Database functions check permissions for every role change and deletion; direct profile updates cannot change the role column.
- Apply `supabase/migrations/010_plan_management.sql` after `009_others_category.sql`. To initialize the **first** administrator, sign up normally, then run this **once in the Supabase SQL Editor** as a database owner, replacing the UUID with that account's Auth user ID:

  ```sql
  update public.users set role = 'admin' where id = '<YOUR_AUTH_USER_UUID>'::uuid;
  ```

  Subsequent administrators can be assigned from `/admin`. No service role key is exposed to the browser.

#### Deployment check for Others and deletion

- The deployed application must include both the `Others` UI and the `delete_plan` call (this branch or a later branch containing it). A deployment still built from an earlier branch, including `main` before these updates are merged, will keep its old category list.
- Run `009_others_category.sql` and `010_plan_management.sql` in the **same Supabase project** configured for that deployment, in that order. `009` renames existing `Build` rows; `010` installs the checked `delete_plan` function. If deletion fails, the page now displays the database error or points out a missing migration instead of only saying "Could not delete plan."

### 2026-09-27 (America/Chicago) — UMN calendar event discovery

- `/events` lists upcoming public events imported from the official UMN Events Calendar JSON feed. Each card identifies the source, the original organizer, and `CampusDate Event Importer`; CampusCrew never represents the imported event as a student-created or University-operated CampusCrew account.
- Students select **Find people to go with** to open a prefilled Plan form. The signed-in student becomes the real Plan creator, and the resulting Plan keeps a link to the original UMN event for current registration, cost, eligibility, schedule, and cancellation details.
- The importer stores only basic event facts, taxonomy labels, and the original source URL. It does not copy event descriptions, images, or contact details.
- Apply `supabase/migrations/011_external_events.sql` after `010_plan_management.sql`, followed by `012_external_event_retention.sql`. Migration `012` also repairs the explicit server-role permissions for projects that applied the original version of `011`. Add `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and a strong `CRON_SECRET` as server-only Vercel environment variables. `UMN_EVENTS_FEED_URL` is optional and is restricted in code to the official `events.tc.umn.edu/live/json/events` endpoint.
- `vercel.json` calls `/api/cron/umn-events` daily at 12:00 UTC. Vercel sends `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>`. To run the first import manually after deployment:

  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
    https://YOUR-DEPLOYMENT.vercel.app/api/cron/umn-events
  ```

- Imported rows are read-only to browser users through RLS. Only the server-side service role can insert or update them. Each recurring event occurrence receives a stable source ID plus start timestamp, so occurrences are not collapsed or duplicated on later imports. Events are marked expired after their reported end, or after a conservative fallback window when the source has no end time. The daily sync retains expired events for 30 days, then permanently deletes only rows that have no student-created Plan referencing them; linked event history remains available.

### 2026-09-27 (America/Chicago) — Sports and concert events

- Browse Events now has `UMN Events`, `Sports`, `Concerts`, and `Expired` filters. The existing daily UMN calendar import remains in place. An optional Ticketmaster Discovery API import adds ticketed Gophers men's basketball and football, Vikings, Twins, Timberwolves, Lakers, Warriors, and Chiefs games, Minnesota concerts, and Taylor Swift concerts where an event is actually published. Search also recognizes LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Patrick Mahomes as team-game interests; team schedules do **not** confirm that any player will appear.
- Configure the server-only `TICKETMASTER_API_KEY` from the Ticketmaster developer portal to enable this second source. The key is never sent to browsers. Without it, the daily UMN feed continues to sync, and the Sports/Concerts filters remain empty until ticketed events are imported. Not every game or concert is necessarily listed by Ticketmaster; event cards link to the original source for current details.
- Run `supabase/migrations/013_sports_concert_retention.sql` after `012_external_event_retention.sql`. The existing daily cron marks past events from both sources `expired`, shows recently expired/canceled events under `Expired`, and deletes unlinked rows after 30 days. Events linked to a student-created plan remain for that plan's history. When one source fails, the other can still update and the cron response reports the failure.
- The Events page also offers individual filters for Gophers men's basketball, Gophers football, Vikings, Twins, Timberwolves, Lakers/LeBron, Warriors/Steph, Chiefs/Mahomes, Taylor Swift, and Minnesota concerts. A filter only shows real imported events; it does not invent a game or imply a particular player is appearing. Deploy this branch, set `TICKETMASTER_API_KEY`, run migration `013`, and allow or trigger the scheduled import before expecting these lists to populate.
